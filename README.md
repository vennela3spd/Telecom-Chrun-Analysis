# 📊 Telecom Churn Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges faced by telecom companies. This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn patterns** using **Power BI** to help businesses understand customer behavior, identify churn drivers, and make data-driven retention strategies.

The dashboard provides a **visual and interactive analysis** of customer demographics, subscription types, usage behavior, and support interactions.

##  Objectives
- Analyze customer churn based on subscription type, gender, and contract length  
- Identify patterns in customer support calls and usage frequency  
- Understand spending behavior across different subscription plans  
- Provide actionable insights to reduce churn  

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Data visualization & dashboard creation  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Measures and calculations  
- **CSV Dataset** – Telecom customer data
